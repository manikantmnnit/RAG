Nonlinearities, such as quantization and overflow, are often introduced in fixed-\\npoint digital filters (DF) implemented on processors with finite wordlength. The\\npresence of these nonlinearities can cause instability in the DF. Numerous studies have\\ndiscussed stability issues with DF vulnerable to overflow oscillations and external dis-\\nturbances (Liu and Michel, 1992; Krishna Rao Kandanvli and Kar, 2008; Arockiaraj\\n1Manuscript\\n Click here to access/download;Manuscript;Manuscript.pdf\\n 1 \\n 2 \\n 3 \\n 4 \\n 5 \\n 6 \\n 7 \\n 8 \\n 9 \\n10 \\n11 \\n12 \\n13 \\n14 \\n15 \\n16 \\n17 \\n18 \\n19 \\n20 \\n21 \\n22 \\n23 \\n24 \\n25 \\n26 \\n27 \\n28 \\n29 \\n30 \\n31 \\n32 \\n33 \\n34 \\n35 \\n36 \\n37 \\n38 \\n39 \\n40 \\n41 \\n42 \\n43 \\n44 \\n45 \\n46 \\n47 \\n48 \\n49 \\n50 \\n51 \\n52 \\n53 \\n54 \\n55 \\n56 \\n57 \\n58 \\n59 \\n60 \\n61 \\n62 \\n63 \\n64 \\n65 '),\n",

Existing criteria, as\\nmentioned in (Arockiaraj and Kokil, 2017; Arockiaraj et al, 2017; Pulikonda and\\nKokil, 2020; Pulikonda et al, 2023), focus on investigating the stability of nonlinear\\nDFs using saturation overflow nonlinearity alone and not considering other types of\\nnonlinearities. However, the DFs used in real-time applications experience a range\\nof nonlinearities; thus, it is necessary to investigate the stability characteristics of\\nDF under external disturbances and various types of nonlinearities. This motivation\\nunderlies the research presented in this work.\\nDriven by the earlier discussion, the present work delves into the issue of stability\\nin externally interfered DFs with generalized overflow nonlinearities by applying the\\npassivity approach. The notable contributions of this brief are as follows:\\n1. Distinct conditions for externally interfered nonlinear DFs dealing with various\\noverflow nonlinearities, including two’s complement, zeroing, saturation, and trian-\\ngular, are discussed through a very strict passivity (VSP) approach. The derived\\nconditions are formulated using linear matrix inequality (LMI) terms.\\n2. An asymptotic stability condition near zero disturbances for nonlinear DF is also\\naddressed.\\nThe structure of this brief is outlined as given. Section II presents a mathematical\\ndescription of the system under consideration and a definition of the problem. Section\\nIII provides novel stability criteria for nonlinear DFs under various overflow nonlin-\\nearities through the VSP approach. Section IV showcases the numerical examples to\\nsupport the theoretical framework. Lastly, concluding remarks are given in Section V.\\nNotations. In this article, we will consistently use the following notations. The null\\nmatrix and unit matrix of appropriate size are denoted as 0andI, respectively. The\\nset of real matrix (vector) is represented as Rk×k(Rk). A negative (positive) definite\\nsymmetric matrix is defined as Bk×k<0(Bk×k>0) and its transpose is given as\\nBT. The symbol ∗denotes the symmetries in the symmetric matrix B.\\n2 Problem Formulation\\nConsider the state-space representation of DF, which is described as follows:\\nx(n+ 1) = f(y(n)) +w(n), (1a)\\ny(n) =Ax(n) +w(n).

These external disturbances can cause oscillations, instability, and other issues in the filter's performance, and it is important to develop criteria and methods to mitigate the effects of external interference and ensure the filter's stability and accuracy.

            "Helpful Answer: A digital filter is an electronic circuit or mathematical process that manipulates digital signals to remove unwanted noise, reduce distortion, or extract useful information. These filters can be implemented using digital signal processing techniques and digital hardware such as microcontrollers or digital signal processors (DSPs). They are commonly used in applications such as audio and image processing, control systems, and communication systems. Digital filters can also be used to perform various types of operations on digital data, such as smoothing,\n"
